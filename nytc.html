      <h2>üì° NYTC 2023 ‚Äì Top¬†8</h2>
      <p>
        National Youth Tech Championship or NYTC in short, is Singapore‚Äôs largest AI Drone and tech competition in Singapore.

 It is organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority(IMDA) in association with Google Cloud. 

More than 230 students from 51 secondary schools participated in the competition and our team was fortunate enough to come within the Top8 schools of the competition. In NYTC 2023 ,i learnt one of the most valuable skills as a newbie programmer, learning how to use libraries effectively and how to adapt to new languages and rules of the libraries in a short period of time. Allowing me to learn how to use more libraries for future project. This team effort, fostered a sense of familiarity with my peers improving my teamwork, communication , coordination skills and leadership skills. We also reviewed the areas of improvement such as working in high pressure environments with effective synergy within the team. The Guest of Honor during the final event was Guest-of-Honour Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Dr Janil Puthucheary and his speech spurred further interest in me to pursue tech further in the coming years.

        This was my first hands-on coding challenge: tackling new APIs, debugging on the fly, and communicating strategy with teammates. The experience sharpened my adaptability, technical problem-solving, and collaboration under pressure.

      <h2>üèÜ NYTC 2024 ‚Äì Top¬†4 + Internship</h2>
      <p>
       In 2024, the National Youth Tech Championship came back stronger with over 300 students participating from 60 secondary schools. 

2024‚Äôs edition placed a stronger focus on equipping the participants in AI coding capabilities. The areas of expertise I learnt include using the Google Cloud‚Äôs Vortex AI tool, Machine Learning and AI deep tech. 

The challenges were more complex and needed advanced coding ai and machine learning skills and coordination. 

This helped me push my boundaries and explore various to achieve the challenges set by the Organisers. 

The Ninja Warrior Obstacle Course in the finals was extremely interesting for us to navigate and we secured the 4th spot in the competition and declared as Champions. In 2024, I used the learnings and key takeaways from the 2023 journey and worked with better synergy as a team and improved skillsets.  It was a proud moment for me to receive the award from Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Digital Development and Information, who was the Guest-of-Honour at the event. My school‚Äôs team also won the Best Cheerleaders Award for extending their unwavering support to me and my team, which further reinforced the importance of teamwork in anything we do. 
      <p>
        After placing Top¬†4, I was awarded an internship opportunity with tech mentors‚Äîan experience that exposed me to real-world development environments, cloud deployment, and large-scale project thinking.
