      <h2>📡 NYTC 2023 – Top 8</h2>
      <p>
        National Youth Tech Championship or NYTC in short, is Singapore’s largest AI Drone and tech competition in Singapore.

 It is organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority(IMDA) in association with Google Cloud. 

More than 230 students from 51 secondary schools participated in the competition and our team was fortunate enough to come within the Top8 schools of the competition. In NYTC 2023 ,i learnt one of the most valuable skills as a newbie programmer, learning how to use libraries effectively and how to adapt to new languages and rules of the libraries in a short period of time. Allowing me to learn how to use more libraries for future project. This team effort, fostered a sense of familiarity with my peers improving my teamwork, communication , coordination skills and leadership skills. We also reviewed the areas of improvement such as working in high pressure environments with effective synergy within the team. The Guest of Honor during the final event was Guest-of-Honour Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Dr Janil Puthucheary and his speech spurred further interest in me to pursue tech further in the coming years.

        This was my first hands-on coding challenge: tackling new APIs, debugging on the fly, and communicating strategy with teammates. The experience sharpened my adaptability, technical problem-solving, and collaboration under pressure.

      <h2>🏆 NYTC 2024 – Top 4 + Internship</h2>
      <p>
        I returned to NYTC in 2024, and our team climbed to a Top 4 position nationally. This time, the competition was more advanced—featuring AI-powered drone challenges and cloud-based training by Google Cloud and IMDA :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
      </p>
      <p>
        After placing Top 4, I was awarded an internship opportunity with tech mentors—an experience that exposed me to real-world development environments, cloud deployment, and large-scale project thinking.
