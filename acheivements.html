    <h2>My Journey</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>üöÄ How I Started Coding (2020)</summary>
      <p>
        I began with block coding back in 2020. It was like solving little digital puzzles‚Äîsimple, visual, and exciting.  
        But as my curiosity grew, I felt limited by dragging blocks. I wanted full control. That‚Äôs when I moved into text-based coding, specifically Python.  
        The shift was huge, but I stuck with it and eventually started building real programs from scratch.
      </p>

    <details>
      <summary>üì° <a href="nytc.html" class="nytc-link">NYTC 2023</a> ‚Äì Top 8 in Singapore</summary>
      <p>
        In 2023, I competed in the <a href="nytc.html" class="nytc-link">National Youth Tech Championship (NYTC)</a> and placed Top 8.  
        My team used Python and the DJI Tello library to program drones. I had to quickly learn new tools, adapt to real-time problems, and work closely with teammates.  
        It was my first serious exposure to applied Python, and I grew tremendously in terms of debugging, collaboration, and technical confidence.
      </p>

      <summary>üèÜ <a href="nytc.html" class="nytc-link">NYTC 2024</a> ‚Äì Top 4 Nationally</summary>
      <p>
        In 2024, I returned stronger. My team placed Top 4 nationally at the <a href="nytc.html" class="nytc-link">NYTC</a>.  
        This time, I was more confident with Python and robotics, and I contributed to strategic decisions during problem-solving.  
        I understood how to communicate better, allocate roles, and think both technically and creatively under pressure.  
        <br /><br />
        As a result of placing Top 4, I was selected for an internship opportunity with industry mentors‚Äîgiving me hands-on exposure to real-world tech environments.  
        This not only validated my skills, but also gave me a chance to apply what I‚Äôve learned in high-pressure, collaborative settings.
      </p>

    <details>
      <summary>‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud + IMDA Exposure</summary>
      <p>
        Alongside NYTC, I was selected for programmes led by Google Cloud and IMDA.  
        I explored cloud platforms, APIs, database design, and data handling.  
        I also learned to think at a system level‚Äîhow to integrate tools, consider scale, and approach projects like a real developer.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>üí° Projects & Full Stack Growth</summary>
      <p>
        Over the years, I‚Äôve built 40+ Python projects‚Äîgames, utilities, automation scripts, even AI prototypes.  
        I also taught myself web development and built this entire portfolio site from scratch.  
        Every project taught me something new‚Äîhow to debug better, improve UI, or write cleaner, more efficient code.

      <summary>üéØ Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) Project ‚Äî Click to Expand</summary>
      <p>
        As the leader of my Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) project, I took the initiative to conceptualize, plan, and execute a meaningful tech solution to a real problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project helped me hone my programming skills, learn effective project management, and develop leadership qualities that are essential when working with a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guided my team through challenges, encouraged collaboration, and ensured we met our goals with quality results.

      <summary>üåê Improving Seniors Digital Literacy ‚Äî Click to Expand</summary>
      <p>
        This was one of the most memorable VIA experiences I took part in.  
        In 2023, I was excited to teach the elderly how to use their phones. During the sessions, I answered their queries.  
        Through this, I realized the importance of patience when teaching seniors and how to enunciate and pronounce words clearly for better understanding.
